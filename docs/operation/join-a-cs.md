## Pre-requisites

Before diving into deployment of your mining operation, please make sure you go through the following steps. 

:::warning

It is recommended that you test your setup in `calibration` network before deploying on `mainnet`. 

:::

### Setup your permanent storage

Choose a network file system that you are familiar with (`NFS` for example) and deploy your storage cluster.

### Get your account setup in Sophon service

There are two ways to have your account setup.

#### For miners connecting to Sophon service

If you are trying to connect to a hosted Sophon service, <!--like ones provided by venus incubation center,--> contact admin of said service and have them set it up for you.

:::tip

venus-wallet can be deployed as either a Sophon service or a local component depend on your security requirement.

:::

#### For admins of Sophon service

If you are an admin hosting Sophon service, use the following command to create an account for your sealer clusters.

```bash
# create user, default state=1
$ ./sophon-auth user add <ACCOUNT_NAME>
# bind miner to user
$ ./sophon-auth user miner add <ACCOUNT_NAME> <MINER_ID> 

# The returned token is what miner have to add into their config file in order to gain access to your shared modules
$ ./sophon-auth token gen --perm write <ACCOUNT_NAME>
<AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

Update user information if necessary.

```bash
./sophon-auth user update --user=<ACCOUNT_NAME> --help
```

### Software dependencies

You will need to install these [software dependencies](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/install/linux/#software-dependencies) (same as Lotus) before running venus.

## Install venus-wallet

Download and compile the source code of venus-wallet.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-wallet.git
# change directory to venus-wallet
$ cd venus-wallet
$ git checkout <RELEASE_TAG>
$ make
```

Run venus-wallet module in background.

```bash
$ nohup ./venus-wallet run > wallet.log 2>&1 &
```

:::tip 

Use `tail -f wallet.log` to monitor wallet log.

:::

Setup a password for your venus-wallet.

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet setpwd
Password:******
Enter Password again:******
Password set successfully
```

:::warning

Please keep backups of your password and store them properly or you will lose contorl of your wallet.

:::

:::warning

When restarting your wallet, manuually unlock your wallet or you wallet won't be able to sign any messages during sealing or other tasks.

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet unlock
Password:
```

Use `--password` for auto unlocking after running.

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet run --password
```

Check current state your wallet.

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet lock-state
wallet state: unlocked
```

:::

Generate owner and worker addresses. (If you don't have an existing miner id)

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet new bls
<OWNER_ADDRESS>
$ ./venus-wallet new bls
<WORKER_ADDRESS>
```

:::tip

If you are testing on `Calibration`, you have to fund all your addresses with test coins from faucets. For calibration, use this [faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/funds.html). 

:::

:::tip

Use `./venus-wallet import` command for importing addresses from private keys.

:::

Change `[APIRegisterHub]` section of  `~/.venus_wallet/config.toml` using the credential you get from Sophon service admin.

```toml
[APIRegisterHub]
RegisterAPI = ["/ip4/<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VENUS_GATEWAY>/tcp/45132"]
Token = "<AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_VENUS_WALLET>"
SupportAccounts = ["<ACCOUNT_NAME>"]
```

:::warning

Make sure above 3 params are correctly set, or connection to Sophon service will fail.

:::

Restart venus-wallet so that the changes takes into effect.

```bash
# grep [PID] of venus-wallet process
$ ps -ef | grep wallet
root   6704  2.3  0.0 2361236 43148 pts/2   Sl   17:33   0:18 ./venus-wallet run
root   8029  0.0  0.0 112828   952 pts/2    S+   17:46   0:00 grep --color=auto venus-wallet
# kill the process and restart
$ kill -9 [PID]
$ nohup ./venus-wallet run > wallet.log 2>&1 &
```

You should see logs close to the following indicating successful connection to `sophon-gateway`.

```bash
2021-07-12T15:14:12.457+0800    INFO    wallet_event    wallet_event/listenevent.go:197 connect to server fcf714b2-eeb6-498b-aafc-5e58eccd9d0f  {"api hub": "/ip4/<IP_ADDRESS>/tcp/45132"}
```

:::tip

Using process controll like  `systemmd` or `supervisord` is recommended.

:::

:::warning

Pls keep the wallet unlock state. If the state is locked , it will block sealer "Waiting for confirmation".

:::

## Install damocles

Download source code.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/damocles.git
```

Compile `damocles`.

```bash
$ cd damocles
$ git checkout <LATEST_RELEASE>
$ make all
```

:::tip
After compilation, two executable, `damocles-worker` and `damocles-manager`, will be generated under `./dist/bin`.
:::

:::tip 
Fetch the Filecoin Proof Parameters if you don't have them already by running the following command:
```bash
./dist/bin/damocles-manager util fetch-params 32GiB
```

### damocles-manager

Initialize work space.

```bash
./dist/bin/damocles-manager daemon init
```

### Create a miner-id (optional)

Skip this step if you already have a miner-id.

```bash
$ ./damocles-manager util miner create 
--from=<OWNER_ADDRESS> 
--owner=<OWNER_ADDRESS> 
--worker=<WORKER_ADDRESS>
--sector-size=32GiB
```
:::tip
Use `--net` param for different network options. Default is mainnet.
:::

:::tip
You will see logs similar to the following once successfully created new miner-id.

```bash
2022-05-09T07:29:51.325Z  INFO  cmd  internal/util_miner.go:242  miner actor: t01219 (t2z4nnndtt2iuu57lq3ivor7xdvqwivwb5renrh3a)  
{"size": "512MiB", "from": "t3wultr2i47m24ew2p3bskclnb4rtgmuwb6cwjleqbeu4ndqocx67635dibpsq3ugpbv5y7fpjlpxlmkqcgnva", 
"actor": "t01166", "owner": "t3wultr2i47m24ew2p3bskclnb4rtgmuwb6cwjleqbeu4ndqocx67635dibpsq3ugpbv5y7fpjlpxlmkqcgnva", 
"worker": "t3wultr2i47m24ew2p3bskclnb4rtgmuwb6cwjleqbeu4ndqocx67635dibpsq3ugpbv5y7fpjlpxlmkqcgnva"}
```

Start `damocles-manager`.

```bash

```

:::tip
Again, use `--net` param for different network options. Default is mainnet.

### damocles-worker

Plan your sealing storage and init directories.

```bash
$ ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store sealing-init -l <dir1> <dir2> <dir3> <...>
```

Attach permanent storage and init directories.

```bash
$ ./dist/bin/damocles-worker store file-init -l <dir1>
```

Plan CPU cores, numa, etc for eahc sealing tasks and tailor your configuration file to it. The following is an example configuration for `damocles-worker`. More detailed instructions on each configurations could be found [here](https://damocles.venus-fil.io/operation/damocles-worker-config.html)

:::tip
You can also reference the configurations in `damocles` [community test](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus/discussions/4866).
:::

Start `damocles-worker`.

```bash
$ /path/to/damocles-worker daemon -c /path/to/damocles-worker.toml
```

:::tip
The above `sector-manager.cfg` and `damocles-worker.toml` are just minimal to get you to start pledging sectors. More detailed information on configurations could be found [here](/zh/cluster/).
:::

:::tip
Note that `name = "xxx"` under `[[attached]]` in `damocles-worker.toml` must be the same `Name = "xxx"` under `[[Common.PersistStores]]` in `sector-manager.cfg`.
